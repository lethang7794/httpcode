   - Write tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation if needed
   - Follow Go best practices

3. **Test your changes**

## Code Style

- Follow standard Go formatting (`go fmt`)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for exported functions
- Keep functions focused and small

## Testing

- Write tests for new functionality
- Maintain or improve test coverage
- Test on multiple Go versions (1.19, 1.20, 1.21)

## Release Process

Releases are automated based on commit messages:

- Push to `main` branch triggers the release workflow
- Version is automatically determined from commit messages
- GitHub release is created with binaries for multiple platforms
